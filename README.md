# Boris Bikes 2

This is a repeat of the first challenge i was set at Makers Academy.

## Why I decided to redo this project. 

I decided that this project had many core skills that are imperative to any level of coding in ruby. Many of these core concepts became more difficult to practice when I ventured into more complicated tasks and larger projects. I decided it would be good for me to go back to basics to ensure i still know how to write clean and readable code. I will make sure to use Doubles, SRP and TDD, I will also be sure to leave time to refactor and follow good processes the whole way through.
